 
Overview of res:
This program is called "Vice City Killer", currently based on a driver to control the whole mechanism. The res folder contains exmaple_runs, one world.txt for correct data, and one world_wrong_data.txt for wrong data. The saved map will be generated when program runs and it will NOT automatically appear in the res folder, you may need to refresh and see that. There is also a jar file in res.




When program runs:

When running my programs, it will first show the current world descriptions, including the size, targetCharacter and so on.
Then it will then ask for the total number of turns you want to have in your game. After you set up that, you will be given a menu of list to select from 3 options, add human players, generate map, exit. after you select add human players and input all the information needed, the menu will becomes  add human players, add computer players, start game, generate map, exit. Then you can choose to add more human players, add computer players or directly start the game with only one human player. If you not exit, and add human player, multiple human players or both humans and computer players, and selected start game. The menu will then become to have all the action option such as pick up, drop, move, look around and so on. There will be no more adding players option. Then if will be the human's turn to select action first, then computer players, then target character. After all actions done of a turn, the target character will move as a fixed order, then this turn will end and go to the next turn. It will end when we reach the max turns we set up in the driver.




For example runs:
There are 3 example runs. They are all general user input cases that can show all required functionality of this milestone. But I still have minor issues that bother me entire several days! I am very very very overwhelmed. Taking 5800 with this course is very tough, and I don't think this deadline is enough for me. I am crazy. I will make things work in a couple days but I really can't make all these by the deadline. Things I haven't do well: Turns count, computer space index record, controller test.



For the JAR file:
I never did such thing before, I suppose you will get my entire classes and so on. You may run the Driver.class at this time to see the console.
